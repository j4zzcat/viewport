        //    originate from different hosts.  This is to permit use of proxies and
        //    other fault-tolerance mechanisms that may cause more than one
        //    responder to be capable of issuing identical answers on the network.
        //
        //    A common example of a resource record type that is intended to be
        //    unique, not shared between hosts, is the address record that maps a
        //    host's name to its IP address.  Should a host witness another host
        //    announce an address record with the same name but a different IP
        //    address, then that is considered inconsistent, and that address
        //    record is considered to be in conflict.

        //    response (solicited or otherwise) containing a conflicting resource
        //    record in any of the Resource Record Sections, the Multicast DNS
        //    responder MUST immediately reset its conflicted unique record to
