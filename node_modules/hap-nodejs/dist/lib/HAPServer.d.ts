/**
 * The actual HAP server that iOS devices talk to.
 *
 * Notes
 * -----
 * It turns out that the IP-based version of HomeKit's HAP protocol operates over a sort of pseudo-HTTP.
 * Accessories are meant to host a TCP socket server that initially behaves exactly as an HTTP/1.1 server.
 * So iOS devices will open up a long-lived connection to this server and begin issuing HTTP requests.
 * So far, this conforms with HTTP/1.1 Keepalive. However, after the "pairing" process is complete, the
 * connection is expected to be "upgraded" to support full-packet encryption of both HTTP headers and data.
 * This encryption is NOT SSL. It is a customized ChaCha20+Poly1305 encryption layer.
 *
 * Additionally, this "HTTP Server" supports sending "event" responses at any time without warning. The iOS
 * device simply keeps the connection open after it's finished with HTTP request/response traffic, and while
 * the connection is open, the server can elect to issue "EVENT/1.0 200 OK" HTTP-style responses. These are
 * typically sent to inform the iOS device of a characteristic change for the accessory (like "Door was Unlocked").
 *
 * See {@link EventedHTTPServer} for more detail on the implementation of this protocol.
