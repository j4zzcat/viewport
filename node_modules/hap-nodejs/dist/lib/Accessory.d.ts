     * When undefined the HAP server will bind to all available interfaces
     * (see https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_server_listen_port_host_backlog_callback).
     *
     * This property accepts a mixture of IPAddresses and network interface names.
     * Depending on the mixture of supplied addresses/names hap-nodejs will bind differently.
     *
     * It is advised to not just bind to a specific address, but specifying the interface name
     * in oder to bind on all address records (and ip version) available.
     *
     * HAP-NodeJS (or the underlying ciao library) will not report about misspelled interface names,
     * as it could be that the interface is currently just down and will come up later.
     *
     * Here are a few examples:
     *  - bind: "::"
     *      Pretty much identical to not specifying anything, as most systems (with ipv6 support)
     *      will default to the unspecified ipv6 address (with dual stack support).
     *
     *  - bind: "0.0.0.0"
     *      Binding TCP socket to the unspecified ipv4 address.
     *      The mdns advertisement will exclude any ipv6 address records.
     *
     *  - bind: ["en0", "lo0"]
     *      The mdns advertising will advertise all records of the en0 and loopback interface (if available) and
     *      will also react to address changes on those interfaces.
     *      In order for the HAP server to accept all those address records (which may contain ipv6 records)
     *      it will bind on the unspecified ipv6 address "::" (assuming dual stack is supported).
     *
     *  - bind: ["en0", "lo0", "0.0.0.0"]
     *      Same as above, only that the HAP server will bind on the unspecified ipv4 address "0.0.0.0".
     *      The mdns advertisement will not advertise any ipv6 records.
     *
     *  - bind: "169.254.104.90"
     *      This will bind the HAP server to the address 0.0.0.0.
     *      The mdns advertisement will only advertise the A record 169.254.104.90.
     *      If the given network interface of that address encounters an ip address change (to a different address),
     *      the mdns advertisement will result in not advertising an address at all.
     *      So it is advised to specify an interface name instead of a specific address.
     *      This is identical with ipv6 addresses.
     *
     *  - bind: ["169.254.104.90", "192.168.1.4"]
     *      As the HAP TCP socket can only bind to a single address, when specifying multiple ip addresses
     *      the HAP server will bind to the unspecified ip address (0.0.0.0 if only ipv4 addresses are supplied,
     *      :: if a mixture or only ipv6 addresses are supplied).
     *      The mdns advertisement will only advertise the specified ip addresses.
     *      If the given network interface of that address encounters an ip address change (to different addresses),
     *      the mdns advertisement will result in not advertising an address at all.
     *      So it is advised to specify an interface name instead of a specific address.
